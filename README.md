# WARP SD Card
This is the files and bash script that will format an SD card to the way I like it for WARP boards

## What's in each slot
Each slot has a different image for the WARP verision 3 board. They are as follows:

Slot | Content | Version | Radios |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Slot 0 | WARPLab | v7.7 | 2 radio |
Slot 1 | WARPLab | v7.7 | 4 radio |
Slot 2 | WARPLab | v7.4 | 2 radio |
Slot 3 | WARPLab | v7.4 | 4 radio |
Slot 4 | 802.11 AP ref design | v1.4 | |
