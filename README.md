# WARP_SD_Card
This is the files and bash script that will format an SD card to the way I like it for WARP boards

## What's in each slot
Each slot has a different image for the WARP verision 3 board. They are as follows:
1. WARPLab version v7.7, 2 radio
2. WARPLab version v7.7, 4 radio
3. WARPLab version v7.4, 2 radio
4. WARPLab version v7.4, 4 radio
5. 802.11 ref design v1.4, 2 radio
6. 802.11 ref design v1.4, 4 radio
